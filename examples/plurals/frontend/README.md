Plurals Frontend
================

This example project defines a very simple project whose job it is to communicate with a backend.

Our product should communicate with the backend through an API, _but_:

 * At the time of developing Plurals Frontend, we have minimal communication with the folks at Plurals Backend, we don't have access to their code.
 * We are not using a wiki to document the API, because wikis are unreliable.
 * We are guaranteed that both ourselves and the developers of Plurals Backend are using a third project, Plurals API, which will (in the real world) probably reside in its own git server, which both teams can have access to.
